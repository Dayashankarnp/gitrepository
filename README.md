### git and github tutorials
init means im initializing a new repository ie git init
readme turns green after initialization git repository
initially U symbol infront of readme file meaning untracked
after git add readme it changes to A meaning added 
then with changes inside the readme it changes to M meaning modified
i can check the staus of readme so i use 'git status'
to remove or unstage readme file use'git rm --chached README.md'
since the readme file is modified it has be added to git again
so the command git add readme.md and A is appeared infront of the readme file
